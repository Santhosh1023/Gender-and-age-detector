# Gender-and-age-detector
Age and Gender Detection with OpenCV
    This Python script performs age and gender detection on images or video streams using deep learning models. It uses OpenCV's DNN module to load pre-trained models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification.

Features
  -> Face Detection: Identifies faces in images or video streams.
  -> Age and Gender Prediction: Estimates age and gender of detected faces.
  -> Display Results: Annotates detected faces with age and gender information.

Models and Prototxt Files
    The script requires several pre-trained models and prototxt files, which you need to download separately:

Face Detection Model:
  -> opencv_face_detector.pbtxt
  -> opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb
  
Age Detection Model:
  -> age_deploy.prototxt
  -> age_net.caffemodel

Gender Detection Model:
  -> gender_deploy.prototxt
  -> gender_net.caffemodel

**How It Works**
Face Detection:
        Uses a pre-trained face detection model to locate faces in the frame.

Age and Gender Prediction:
       For each detected face, extracts the face region, preprocesses it, and feeds it into age and gender prediction models.
The results are then annotated on the original image.

Display:
       The processed image or video stream is displayed with annotations showing the predicted age and gender.

**Troubleshooting**
No Faces Detected: 
      Ensure the face detection model files are correct and not corrupted. Adjust the conf_threshold if necessary.

Model Not Found Errors: 
      Verify that all required model and prototxt files are in the correct directory.
